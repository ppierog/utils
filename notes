1. Do not mix signed and unsigned operation
Promotion to unsigned

unsigned char a = -1 ; // -> 0xFF
signed char = 256;     //-> undefined

signed + unsigned = > Promotion to unsigned !!!

char a = -42;
unsigned char b = 10;
cout << a + b -> 255 - 32 -> 223

int i = 42, *p = &i;
decltype(*p) z ; // Wy≈Çuskanie pointer to jest referencja

string a = "aslk12"   // copy initialization
strinfg a ("aslk122") // direct initialization
sting a{"aslk12"} // direct initialization

string s = ""s + ""s
